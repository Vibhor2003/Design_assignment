# Design_assignment

I used figma for my design assignment and it was very enjoying, interface of figma is really great

I have my project and in two formats(.fig and pdf) but still I am giving a link to see my prototype - https://www.figma.com/file/0DSfsWW6josMdlEo776flV/Design?node-id=0%3A1

Hope you like my work

# Note

I didn't try coding part(bonus) , beacause I was out of time
